Provides various debugging methods for Android applications, including tracing and allocation counts.

**Logging Trace Files**

Debug can create log files that give details about an application, such as a call stack and start/stop times for any running methods. See [Inspect Trace Logs with Traceview](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/traceview) for information about reading trace files. To start logging trace files, call one of the startMethodTracing() methods. To stop tracing, call `stopMethodTracing()`.
