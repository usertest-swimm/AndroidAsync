title: FileUriExposedException
file_version: 1.1.3
app_version: 1.12.1
---

The exception that is thrown when an application exposes a `file://` `Uri` to another app.

This exposure is discouraged since the receiving app may not have access to the shared path. For example, the receiving app may not have requested the `Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` runtime permission, or the platform may be sharing the `Uri` across user profile boundaries.

Instead, apps should use `content://` Uris so the platform can extend temporary permission for the receiving app to access the resource.

This is only thrown for applications targeting `Build.VERSION_CODES#N` or higher. Applications targeting earlier SDK versions are allowed to share `file://` `Uri`, but it's strongly discouraged.

**See also:**

*   `FileProvider`

*   `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`
